# A standard to handle nulling interferometry data

## Breaking news:

Standards live and die by their community. In order to get in touch with our community, we have an *ongoing poll*. If you are interested in NIFITS, help us to build a strong, welcoming and prolific community by answering [this poll](https://forms.gle/HVECwQCz8PE6Tvic9).

We are looking for a date for our first community hackathon. The event will take the form of two consecutive days of recommended hackathon work, split between two groups to accommodate different timezone groups. The **early group will operate on two consecutive CEST mornings to be compatible with Australian schedules**. The **late group will operate on two consecutive CEST afternoons to be more compatible with the American schedules**.

Each will start with a 30-45 minutes webinar presentation of the standard and its supporting library, and close on the next day with a quick presentation of the accomplishments from each teams (during the last 30 minutes). The goal is to help you kickstart your own application in constructive (virtual) environment with the **live availability of the NIFITS core team**. This will happen on August 11 and 12 , 2025. Email Romain Laugier to register.


## The `nifits` package

The `nifits` package has two roles:

* Help create and manipulate NIFITS files in python with the `io` module
* Offer a simple backend to use the instrument *model in a kit* packaged within the files with the `backend` module.

The documentation is a work in progress and can be found here: [API documentation](https://rlaugier.github.io/nifits_doc.github.io/)
The basic functionalities of the package are demonstrated in the `examples/quick_start.ipynb` notebook.

## Spirit

This data standard aims to facilitate the exchange of nulling interferometry data and the proliferation of nulling data reduction methods among the community. It should make available all the instrumental information necessary to deploy the most advanced data reduction algorithms. It should be suitable to hold the raw data (to the exception of detector data) for reduction, or the reduced and co-added data for interpretation.

Nulling interferometry can take many forms. Simple Bracewell, Double Bracewell, Kernel Nuller, active chopping etc. For this reason, the data is useless without the corresponding description of the instrument.

The work of this consortium will focus on laying out and demonstrating the principle of operation of the NIFITS standard, including the respective roles of *the creator* of files *the user* of files, and third party libraries.

## Requirements
### Top level
The data standard should be compatible with ground-based existing facilities and space-based instrument.

It should rely on OIFITS standard data format as much possible so as to facilitate reuse of the relevant code base. It will provide the additional information relevant to the specificities of nulling interferometry. Candidates for OIFITS reference:

* [oifits-sim, by bkloppenborg](https://github.com/bkloppenborg/oifits-sim)
* [oifits, by Paul Boley](https://github.com/pboley/oifits/forks)


### Creator, user, and library.

The goal is to allow interpretation by scientific teams outside of the expert instrument team. For this the standard must ensure that the *the user* can perform interpretation of the data without any expertise in the instrument.

The responsibility of expertise in the instrument lies onto *the creator*, and in particular on the data recording, and preliminary reduction stage, which are typically built by the instrument team. The standard dictates in what form they should save the metadata.

The standard dictates the normalized algorithm using the metadata as an instrument simulator to be used by *the user* in interpretation and inference. This operation is ensured by third party *libraries* following the guidelines of the standard, serving in ways similar to **OIMODELER** or **PMOIRED**.


### Common to reduction and interpretation stage
Since part of the metadata must be recorded during the acquisition, it makes sense that partial forms of the standard be created durin acquisition to be completed during the preliminary reduction, before archiving.

## Provisional definition (as of 06/2024)

### Basic working principle

To allow for full flexibility and the behavior of the instrument is packaged under the form of a complex amplitude transfer matrix (see e.g. Guyon 2013) which describes the linear combinations of complex input electric fields into complex output electric fields. This matrix has a column for each input (and therefore collecting telescope) and a row for each output. This matrix is stored for each wavelength into a datacube in the `NI_CATM` extension.

The vector of complex amplitude inputs can be computed for each elementary source of the field of view, in particular based on its position in the field of view ($\alpha$, $\beta$), which gives it a given phase based on the relative projected position of each collector ($x$, $y$) stored for each frame into the `NI_MOD` extension described below. This extension also contains for each frame the timestamps and the complex phasors expressing the state of a potential internal modulation applied by the instrument. Additional phasors representing the field of view falloff (expressed in `NI_FOV`) are also applied to the individual input electric fields.

The forward model of an observation can be computed by multiplying the resulting vector of complex input electric fields by the transfer matrix of the combiner to obtain its outputs, and taking its square modulus corresponds to the output intensity. Doing that for each spectral channel gives the forward model that can be compared to the direct observation output data stored in `NI_IOUT`.

For the case of staged beam combiners (double Bracewells, kernel nullers...) that use differential output the "kernel" matrix can be provided in the `NI_KMAT` under the form of a matrix operating on output intensities. The vector resulting from this additional transformation can then be compared to the processed data stored into the `NI_KIOUT` extension.

The following description details the extensions used for NIFITS. Until the offcial publication of the standard, the details of operation can be infered from the `examples/quick_start.ipynb` notebook which details both creation and usage of a simple file. Feel free to contact us through Issues or email for more details.

Important implementation hints:
`NI_CATM` contains the static properties of the combiner that should rarely need to be updated.
`NI_MOD` contains phasors applied to each inputs, and that can be different for each temporal data point. It also contains the projected location of the collecting elements into the plane orthogonal to the line of sight.

Additional data still under discussion:

* Raw null posterior estimate:
  - Error estimation of raw outputs (`NI_IOUT`) is complicated because it is non-Gaussian. Since the nulling self-calibration computes a posterior PDF of the outputs, providing a PDF to the user seems relevant.
  - Error estimates are of differential outputs are close to Gaussian but are correlated in wavelength and between output pairs. Providing a covariance matrix estimate is relevant in that case, but this requires unambiguous flattening of these dimensions.
* Handling of polarization information
  - Expansion of the current system should allow the standard to handle polarized light.
* Handling of reference star calibration

### Update notes:

* Standard 0.3 (package version >= 0.0.5):
  - The NIFITS-relate header keywords are now explicitly `HIERARCH` keywords. They are stored under `HIERARCH NIFITS`
  - Files from previous version which have the simple keywords stored without this distinction will work but throw a deprecation warning.
  - This was done by decorating `astropy.io.fits.Header.__getitem__`, catching an exception and looking for the bare keyword.
* Standard 0.2 (package version >= 0.0.4):
  - The units of NI_IOUT, NI_KIOUT and NI_KCOV must be provided whith the header keyword `NIFITS IUNIT`. The format
    should be compatible with exporting to(and from ) string with astropy.units (i.e. `astropy.units.Unit("")` 
    and `astropy.units.Unit.to_string()`).
  - `Extra` now offers observable whitening, energy detector test statistic, p-value (aka pfa) and sensitivity limit in the blackbody hypothesis (see Ceau et al. 2019, Laugier et al. 2023).
* The package now also include a nifits file viewer which requires streamlit and [kernuller](github.com/rlaugier/kernuller). This is a prototype/demonstrator for a future standalone tool.
